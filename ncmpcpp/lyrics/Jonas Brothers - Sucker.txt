You are the one, the sun, the light of day
You are the wings I need to fly away

When you give me love, I
Feel it, I feel it, I feel like
I ran through the ceilin', the ceilin', the ceilin'
No, my life, it never had a meanin', a meanin', a meanin'
You gave me a reason, you've got me believin', you're makin' me say

You are the one, the sun, the light of day (Yeah)
You are the wings I need to fly away

When you give me love, when you give me love, I
Feel it, I feel it, it feels like
I ran through the ceilin', the ceilin', the ceilin'
No, my life, it never had a meanin', a meanin', a meanin'
You gave me a reason, you got me believin', you're makin' me say

You are the wings I need to fly away (The wings I need to fly)
You are the wings I need to fly away

It was you (It was you)
It was you, it was you from the very start, oh
Always knew (Always knew)
Always knew, you know you gave me a
Reason, you've got me believin', you're makin' me say

You are the one, the sun, the light of day (Mm, mm)
You are the wings I need to fly away
